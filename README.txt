Project Goal: Personal Name Card Application
By the end of today, we will build a beautiful personal name card application. In the 21st century, we no longer need to hand out physical name cards. Instead, you can create a website that displays your name and includes links to relevant pages.

This website will showcase your design skills and provide your contact details effectively.
